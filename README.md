# annt's nixvim

The following project is a my personally curated configuration for
[neovim](https://neovim.io).

This configuration is written using Nix. This allows me to easily use this
customized configuration on any machine with Nix installed.
There is no package manager step, everything is handled behind the scenes by
[Nix](https://nixos.org) +
[nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&type=packages&query=vimPlugins) +
[nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim).

## Features

**Treesitter**:

- Enabled for most, if not all filetypes; no compilation required

## Goals

- Avoid raw _lua/vimscript_ code as much as possible to favor _nixification_;
  `nixvim` should handle the configuration

## Get It

You may try this Neovim configuration without any installation. This does not
affect your own settings.

```sh
nix run github:anntnzrb/nixvim
```

You can also alias the above command for convenience.

```sh
alias e='nix run github:anntnzrb/nixvim --'

# open any file
e ~/.bashrc
```

### Installing via Nix Profiles

```sh
nix profile install github:anntnzrb/nixvim
```
